# Alpha Music App Crash Analysis

## Problem
The app crashes and gets closed whenever trying to play music. This happens after selecting a song/album from the interface.

## Likely Causes

1. **Memory Issues with TrackPlayer**: 
   - The app is experiencing memory leaks or excessive memory usage when handling audio playback.
   - When the `TrackPlayer` attempts to buffer or process large audio files, it might be exhausting device memory.

2. **Network Data Handling**: 
   - From the logs, we can see successful API connectivity and that the app finds tracks with 320kbps quality.
   - High-quality audio streams (320kbps) might be causing buffer overflows or memory issues on certain devices.

3. **Resource Management**: 
   - The current implementation creates multiple fallback strategies that might be adding complexity and instability.
   - If the `AbortController` for network checks is not properly cleaned up, it could cause memory leaks.

4. **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: 
   - Some async operations in the playback chain might be failing silently without proper error handling.

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Optimize TrackPlayer Configuration**:
   - Reduce buffer sizes further (current: minBuffer: 5, maxBuffer: 30)
   - Try setting `minBuffer: 2, maxBuffer: 15` to reduce memory usage

2. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add try/catch blocks around all TrackPlayer operations
   - Implement global error handling for promise rejections

3. **Quality Management**:
   - Default to lower quality streams initially (96kbps) and add an option to switch to higher quality
   - Implement progressive quality loading - start with low quality while buffering higher quality

4. **Resource Cleanup**:
   - Ensure all controllers, timers, and listeners are properly cleaned up with useEffect cleanup functions
   - Release any resources when component unmounts or when switching tracks

5. **Platform-Specific Handling**:
   - Implement separate playback strategies for Android and iOS as they handle audio resources differently

The most urgent fix would be optimizing the TrackPlayer configuration and implementing proper error boundaries around the playback logic.
